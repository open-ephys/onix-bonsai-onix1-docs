title: Device Group Configuration Operators
---

Device Group configuration operators belong in a top-level configuration chain between
[CreateContext](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.CreateContext) and
[StartAcquisition](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.StartAcquisition) to configure ONIX hardware. These are
known as Device Group configuration operators because they configure a group of devices on a given
headstage, miniscope, breakout board, etc. [!INCLUDE [device
