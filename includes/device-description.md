Devices represent physical element interfacing with the environment (e.g., an external
sensor with a digital communication interface like the BNO055, Neuropixels probes, or RHS2116
stimulus trigger) or internal data sources (e.g., a controller based digital logic module
that generates system status reports like the port status controller).
