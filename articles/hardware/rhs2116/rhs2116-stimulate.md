The following excerpt from the HeadstageRhs2116 [example workflow](xref:rhs2116) demonstrates the Rhs2116
stimulation functionality by streaming and saving data from the Rhs2116 device.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.DigitalInput> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.DigitalInputDataFrame>s.
Although the digital inputs are sampled at 4 Mhz, these data frames are only emitted when the port status changes (i.e.,
when a pin, button, or switch is toggled). In the Breakout Board example workflow, the `DigitalInput`'s `DeviceName`
property is set to "BreakoutBoard/DigitalInput". This links the `DigitalInput` operator to the corresponding
configuration operator. 

<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.BreakoutButtonState> is selected from the `DigitalInputDataFrame`. It is an enumerator with values
that correspond to bit positions of the breakout board's digital port. `Buttons` connects to `Condition` which is
inspectable with the <kbd>F12</kbd> hotkey. `Condition` contains a `HasFlags` operator. Because `HasFlags`'s `Value` is
set to "Triangle", its output is "True" when the selected `BreakoutButtonState` bit field contains the "Triangle" flag.
Therefore, the conditional statement evaluates as true whenever the "Triangle" button is pressed in which case the
upstream `BreakoutButtonState` element emitted by `Condition` to `Double`. `Double` emits a value of type <xref:System.Double>
to <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhs2116StimulusTrigger>
anytime it receives an item in its upstream sequence. 

When `Rhs2116StimulusTrigger` receives a double from the upstream sequence, a stimulus waveform is triggered. The
waveform can be modified by `Rhs2116StimulusTrigger`'s properties.
