The following excerpt from the Headstage64 [example workflow](xref:hs64_hs64) demonstrates the Rhd2164 functionality by streaming and saving data from the Rhd2164 device.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhd2164Data> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhd2164DataFrame>s using
the following properties settings:
- `BufferSize` is set to 30. Each `Rhd2164DataFrame` will contain a [1 x 30 sample] `Clock` vector, a [64 channel x 30
  sample] `AmplifierData` matrix, and a [3 channel x 30 sample] `AuxData` matrix. This corresponds to 1 ms of data per
  data frame.
- `DeviceName` is set to "Headstage64/Rhd2164". This links the `Rhd2164Data` operator
  to the corresponding configuration operator.

The relevant members are selected from the `Rhd2164DataFrame` by right-clicking the `Rhd2164Data` operator and
choosing the following **Output** members: `Clock`, `AmplifierData`, and `AuxData`. The
[MatrixWriter](xref:Bonsai.Dsp.MatrixWriter) operators saves the selected members to
files with the following format: `rhd2164-clock_<filecount>.raw`, `rhd2164-amplifier_<filecount>.raw`, and
`rhd2164-aux_<filecount>.raw`, respectively.
